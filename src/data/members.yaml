  introduction: Hi, I am a PhD student at MIT Sloan in the Information Technologies (IT) group - a subgroup of the Management Science program - where I am advised by Thomas Malone. My research area is Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Social Computing, which are subfields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Specifically, I am interested in building interactive systems that support collaborative interactions.
